## Python Programming Preferences

* For scripts that run stand alone
  * use PEP 723 syntax compatible with uv run
  * Establish a shabang consistent with uv run
* Do not use f-strings unless you're actually doing string interpolation.
* Use type hints where possible.
* Adhere to the ruff formatting syntax where possible.
